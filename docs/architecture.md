# Architecture

`flutter_md` is four layers with a strict one-way dependency flow:

```
String ──► Parser ──► Node model ──► Render layer ──► Screen
                          │              ▲
                          └── Selection ─┘  (anchored on the model, geometry from the render layer)
```

1. **Parser** (`lib/src/parser.dart`) turns a `String` into an immutable
   `Markdown` (`lib/src/markdown.dart`) whose `blocks` are `MD$Block` nodes
   (`lib/src/nodes.dart`).
2. **Render layer** (`lib/src/render/`, driven by `MarkdownWidget` in
   `lib/src/widget.dart`) paints the model onto a canvas via one `RenderBox` and
   a list of `BlockPainter`s — there is no widget per block.
3. **Selection** (`lib/src/selection.dart`, `lib/src/selection_scope.dart`) holds
   the selection as logical anchors over the immutable models, and reads geometry
   from mounted render objects for hit-testing/highlight/handles.
4. **Theme** (`lib/src/theme.dart`) supplies styles and the customization hooks
   (`builder`, `blockFilter`, `spanFilter`) that the render layer reads.

The parser and node model are stable ground; the render layer was reorganized
into `lib/src/render/**` (see [rendering](rendering.md)). Selection is the newest
subsystem (issue #25).

## Data flow, end to end

`Markdown.fromString(src)` → `MarkdownDecoder.convert` → `Markdown{markdown,
blocks}`. You hand that `Markdown` to a `MarkdownWidget`:

```dart
MarkdownWidget(markdown: Markdown.fromString(src), theme: myTheme)
```

`MarkdownWidget` (a `LeafRenderObjectWidget`) creates a `MarkdownRenderObject`
(a `RenderBox`), which owns a `MarkdownPainter`. The painter builds a
`List<BlockPainter>` (one per non-filtered block, via `theme.builder ??`
defaults), lays them out top-to-bottom recording each block's top-`y` in
`_blockOffsets`, and paints them into a cached `ui.Picture` keyed by size.

For selection, the same widget opts in when given a `documentId` **and** a
resolvable `MarkdownSelectionController` (explicit or via an ambient
`MarkdownSelectionScope`). The render object then registers itself with the
controller as a `MarkdownSelectionSurface`, heals the document into the registry
on attach, and paints the selection highlight (looked up from the controller) on
top of the glyphs, so it stays visible over opaque backgrounds. Registry remove
is deferred while a surface is still mounted. See [selection](selection.md).

## Why the model is immutable and selection anchors to it

Selection must span multiple blocks and multiple `MarkdownWidget`s (e.g. an
entire chat), including messages whose widgets are scrolled off and disposed by a
`ListView`. So the selection is stored as `(documentId, blockIndex,
renderedOffset)` over an app-supplied registry of immutable `Markdown` models,
not over render objects. Text extraction reads the models directly and works even
when nothing is mounted; only mounted surfaces contribute geometry (highlight
rects, handles). This is the core design decision; the alternatives (Flutter's
`SelectableRegion`, a custom selection delegate).

## Load-bearing invariants

These are cross-cutting; each subsystem doc repeats the ones it owns.

- **Glyph cache.** `MarkdownPainter` caches one `ui.Picture` keyed by paint size;
  it is reused on every repaint and only nulled by `update`/`invalidateLayout`
  (model/theme change or system-font change). Repaints from selection or
  horizontal pan/fling must not invalidate it. **`HorizontallyPannableBlock`s are
  omitted from the Picture** and painted live afterward (clip + translate), so
  scroll offset is never baked into the cache.
- **Highlight outside the cache.** The selection highlight is drawn _after_ and
  _outside_ the cached `Picture` (on top of glyphs), so drags/streaming/pan
  repaint only the highlight layer. For pannable blocks, highlight rects are
  clipped to the block viewport. `MarkdownRenderObject.isRepaintBoundary` is true
  whenever a controller is attached, isolating those repaints.
- **Offset-space agreement.** A `SelectableBlockPainter`'s `renderedText` and
  fragment offsets must equal `markdownBlockRenderedText(block)` (lists join items
  with `\n`; tables join cells with `\t`, rows with `\n`; dividers/spacers are
  empty). Hit-testing, highlight geometry, and copied text all index the same
  space. `blockFilter` may drop blocks, but `_sourceIndices` preserves the true
  `Markdown.blocks` index so anchors stay valid.
- **Span offsets.** Concatenating a block's `MD$Span.text` reproduces its rendered
  text; `start/end` index that visible text. See [parser](parser.md) for the
  escape/math/link caveats.

## Public API surface

Everything public is re-exported from `lib/flutter_md.dart`:

- **Whole-file exports:** `markdown.dart`, `nodes.dart`, `parser.dart`,
  `selection.dart`, `selection_scope.dart`, `theme.dart`, `widget.dart`.
- **Curated `show` from `render.dart`:** the `BlockPainter` framework
  (`BlockPainter`, `SelectableBlockPainter`, `HorizontallyPannableBlock`,
  `SelectableTextBlock`,
  `MultiPainterSelectable`, `SelectableFragment`, `ParagraphGestureHandler`,
  `paragraphFromMarkdownSpans`) and the default painters
  (`BlockPainter$Paragraph … $Spacer`, plus opt-in `$ScrollableTable`).

Deliberately **not** public (reachable only via `import 'package:flutter_md/src/render.dart'`,
annotated `@meta.internal`): `MarkdownPainter`, `MarkdownRenderObject`. Treat the
`show` list as the supported surface; additions to it are permanent commitments.

## Where to make a change

- New/changed Markdown syntax → `parser.dart` (+ maybe `nodes.dart`); add
  regression tests. See [parser](parser.md).
- Change how a block looks → a `BlockPainter$*` in `render/blocks/`, or supply
  `MarkdownThemeData.builder` for a custom painter. See [rendering](rendering.md).
- Selection behavior (gestures, keyboard, extraction, streaming) → `selection.dart`
  / `selection_scope.dart`. See [selection](selection.md).
- Tooling, CI, conventions → [development](development.md).
