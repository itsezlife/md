## Unreleased

### Horizontally pannable blocks
- **ADDED**: `BlockPainter$ScrollableTable` for wide tables that clip and pan
  instead of overflowing. Pick it in `MarkdownThemeData.builder`; the default
  `BlockPainter$Table` is unchanged. Pass `enabled: false` to keep the clip but
  refuse new pan; `restoreScrollOffset` still applies so a disabled rebuild does
  not wipe the controller pan store. Painters that implement
  `HorizontallyPannableBlock` get touch pan and fling from the render object
  (mouse/stylus keep selection; wheel/trackpad pan when `|dx| >= |dy|`). Offsets
  live on `MarkdownSelectionController` (`horizontalPanOffset` /
  `setHorizontalPanOffset` / `replaceHorizontalPanOffsets`), survive remount,
  and remap on `putDocument` / `setDocuments` (same-index text match, same-index
  table kind across streaming edits, else content-anchored). Dry layout does not
  commit pan. A temporary fit-width layout does not clear a stored offset. Leading
  edge follows `textDirection` (RTL from the right). Fling respects `TickerMode`.
  Pan paints outside the glyph `Picture` cache; selection highlights stay clipped
  to the table viewport. `MarkdownHorizontalPanStore` is the remount contract
  (`MarkdownSelectionController` implements it).

### Breaking vs 0.2.0

Source-breaking only for hosts that implement the render / selection
extension points or reach into a default block painter's fields. Ordinary
`MarkdownWidget` / `MarkdownSelectionScope` users are unaffected.

- **REMOVED**: `BlockPainter$Quote.painter` and `BlockPainter$Alert.bodyPainter`.
  Both painters now stack nested children, so a single body `TextPainter` no
  longer exists. Read `renderedText` / `fragments` (from
  `MultiPainterSelectable`) instead.
- **CHANGED**: `BlockPainter$Quote` and `BlockPainter$Alert` mix in
  `MultiPainterSelectable` instead of `SelectableTextBlock`. Subclasses that
  overrode `selectionPainter` / `selectionOrigin` must move to `fragments`.
- **CHANGED**: `SelectableBlockPainter` gained `positionAndAffinityForLocal`,
  `caretRectFor`, `hitsRenderedTextAt` and
  `selectionHighlightAboveCachedContent`. Custom painters built on the
  `SelectableTextBlock` / `MultiPainterSelectable` mixins inherit working
  implementations; painters that `implements SelectableBlockPainter` directly
  must add all four.
- **CHANGED**: `MarkdownSelectionSurface` gained `hitForGlobal`,
  `hitsSelectableGlyphs`, `isLinkAtGlobal`, `caretRectFor`,
  `localBoxesForRange`, `hasSelectionHandleLeaders` and
  `clearSelectionHandleLayersIfLinked`. Custom surfaces must implement them.
- **CHANGED**: `MarkdownThemeData.copyWith` returns `MarkdownThemeData` instead
  of `ThemeExtension<MarkdownThemeData>` (callers gain, overriders must narrow).
- **CHANGED**: `MarkdownRenderObject.updateSelection` takes an optional
  `markdown:`. `@meta.internal`, but `MarkdownWidget` subclasses that call it
  must now invoke it **before** `update` (see the registry fix below).

### Quote / alert nested fenced code
- **FIXED**: Fenced code (` ```lang ` / `~~~`) inside a blockquote or GitHub
  alert is re-parsed as nested `MD$Code` in `MD$Quote.blocks` /
  `MD$Alert.blocks`, instead of being consumed as inline monospace by backtick
  pairing (` `` ` + monospace + ` `` `).
- **ADDED**: Optional `blocks` on `MD$Quote` / `MD$Alert` (empty for leaf
  inline bodies). Render and `markdownBlockRenderedText` walk nested children
  when present.
- **FIXED**: Prose nested inside a quote (paragraphs/lists/headings beside a
  fence) uses `quoteStyle` again; code/table chrome keeps the document theme.
- **FIXED**: Nested children route through `MarkdownThemeData.builder` like
  top-level blocks. A host that replaces the code painter (a fence with a copy
  button, say) was silently getting the default one inside `> …`.

### Glyph-tight hit testing
- **CHANGED**: Hover I-beam and link hit-testing use rendered **line/glyph
  boxes**, not the full max-width layout of a paragraph. Empty horizontal
  gutter beside a short line is no longer I-beam / click-to-open.
- **CHANGED**: Gesture *starts* (`hitsSelectableContent`) stay **surface-
  bounds**. A press inside the document or bubble arms text selection.
  Drag-extend may still clamp outside glyphs.
- **CHANGED**: Mouse single-click that misses selectable content while a
  non-collapsed range is active clears the selection, instead of leaving
  the old range.
- **ADDED**: `SelectableBlockPainter.hitsRenderedTextAt`,
  `MarkdownSelectionSurface.hitsSelectableGlyphs`, and
  `MarkdownSelectionController.hitsSelectableGlyphs`.
- **CHANGED**: Glyph boxes are cached per `TextPainter` layout. They are read on
  every hover event (I-beam / link cursor); recomputing
  `getBoxesForSelection` over a whole block allocated one box per run per line
  on every mouse move (thousands of rects over a long fenced code block).

### Selection host gates
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionScope.canStartSelectionAt` — optional host gate
  so enclosing UIs can refuse selection starts on chrome (links, code headers)
  without the scope claiming the pointer. A refusal also un-arms the drag: the
  recognizers still join the arena while a range is live (so a chrome tap can
  dismiss it), and without this a long press / drag on refused chrome kept
  extending the active selection from that point.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionScope.enableTouchGestures` — when false, touch /
  stylus / trackpad selection recognizers stay off; mouse multi-click, handles,
  toolbar, and keyboard remain. Focus loss also does not clear the range (host
  viewport may steal focus).
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionScope.enableTouchConsecutiveTaps` — when false
  (with `enableTouchGestures` true), touch long-press → word → drag-extend
  still arms, but touch multi-tap / horizontal-drag selection does not. Chat
  hosts use this so taps stay with the viewport while continuous text entry
  works. Focus loss also does not clear the range in that mode.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionScope.ownsSelectionChrome` — optional host gate
  so only the scope that owns the selection’s document paints handles/toolbar
  when several scopes share one controller (chat per-body mounts).
- **FIXED**: Disabled / non-owning sibling scopes no longer clear handle
  leaders on every shared-controller surface. Clearing is scoped to leaders
  that reference that scope’s own `LayerLink`s, so chat dual mounts keep
  handles after non-collapsed range commits (including repeated handle-drag
  settles).
- **FIXED**: A scope that loses `ownsSelectionChrome` for the live selection
  document now removes its own context-menu overlay (and does the same when
  handles are disabled for that reason). Previously only handles were cleared,
  so a prior bubble’s adaptive toolbar could linger after selection moved to a
  sibling scope. `toolbarWanted` is left alone so the owning scope can still
  restore on settle.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionSurface.hasSelectionHandleLeaders`,
  `clearSelectionHandleLayersIfLinked`, and
  `MarkdownSelectionScopeState.selectionHandleLeadersAttached` for observing
  coherent handle-leader attachment across multi-scope hosts.
- **CHANGED**: Flipping `enabled` from false → true with an existing
  non-collapsed range restores handles; when `toolbarWanted` is set, restores
  the toolbar. While disabled, the scope stays inert for chrome (no toolbar /
  handles) but keeps `toolbarWanted` for that restore path.

### Dynamic cursor resolution & span bounding boxes
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownThemeData.cursorResolver` and
  `MarkdownWidget.cursorResolver` (`MarkdownCursorResolver`) — unopinionated
  hook to dynamically resolve hover mouse cursors per local offset, block
  index, and block model, falling back to default link/text/defer cursors when
  returning null.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionSurface.localBoxesForRange` and
  `MarkdownPainter.localBoxesForRange` — fast query returning content-local
  bounding boxes for an arbitrary character range within a block, directly from
  cached block painters without re-layout.

### Line clamp
- **ADDED**: `clampMarkdownToLines` / `MarkdownLineClamp` — painter-measured
  height for the first N visual text lines at a given width (line-boundary cut;
  spacers/dividers add height without spending the line budget). Callers size a
  clipped box; the renderer itself has no line budget.

### Registry / multi-body selection
- **FIXED**: `removeDocument` defers while a surface for that id is mounted
  and flushes on `detachSurface`; a later `putDocument` cancels the pending
  remove. Parent `State.dispose` can run before child detach — eager remove
  left hittable surfaces with no registry entry (`rangeFor` / ordering broken).
- **FIXED**: `rangeFor` and endpoint ordering ignore unregistered document ids
  instead of treating them as index `-1` (which painted every body from the
  start of the registry through the other endpoint).
- **CHANGED**: `MarkdownRenderObject` heals with `putDocument` on attach /
  when the controller is wired while already attached, so a mounted selectable
  surface is never missing from the registry. Prefer explicit app registration
  for unmounted docs and unique reading-order `order` values.
- **FIXED**: Recycling a `MarkdownWidget` element onto a different `documentId`
  (a virtualized chat list reusing a slot) overwrote the **outgoing** document's
  registry model with the incoming body. `MarkdownWidget` now rewires the
  selection registry before pushing the new model, and
  `MarkdownRenderObject.updateSelection` takes the incoming `markdown:` so the
  heal lands on the right id.
- **FIXED**: `putDocument` without an explicit `order` appended at `_docs.length`
  which sorted **ahead** of sparse explicit orders (chat hosts key `order` on
  the message id), so a healed body jumped to the front of the conversation and
  reversed extracted text. It now sorts after every registered document.
- **FIXED**: Documents sharing an `order` could swap places on any re-sort
  (`List.sort` is not stable), silently reversing extracted text. Ties now break
  on registration sequence.
- **FIXED**: `MarkdownSelectionScope.onSelectionChanged` fired synchronously
  from inside build / layout — a streaming `putDocument` reconciling the range
  away (from `MarkdownWidget.updateRenderObject`) or a deferred
  `removeDocument` flushing from `RenderObject.detach` threw
  "setState() called during build" in any host that rebuilds from the callback.
  Delivery is now coalesced to the end of the frame in those phases.

### Selection chrome (SelectionArea parity)
- **ADDED**: Read-only selection chrome on the controller /
  `MarkdownSelectionScope` path brought up to Flutter `SelectableRegion` /
  `SelectionArea` quality without remounting SelectionArea:
  - Content-gated touch `TapAndHorizontalDragGestureRecognizer` + long-press
    (consecutive taps, no `DoubleTapGestureRecognizer` arena delay); mouse
    `TapAndPanGestureRecognizer`.
  - Gesture **starts** require a hit on mounted selectable markdown (chrome /
    empty space do not nearest-neighbor clamp); clamp remains for **extend**
    across gaps.
  - Soft-wrap affinity on handles; directed base/extent edges with reverse
    handle types; coincident-caret separation; handle proxies when an endpoint
    surface unmounts (virtualization).
  - Native `SelectionOverlay` handles + magnifier on touch; LeaderLayer follow
    across scroll / multi-widget hosts.
  - Keyboard Copy / Select-all / Shift-extend / Esc; adaptive Copy / Select-all
    toolbar with live re-anchoring.
  - Word / block granular multi-tap and long-press; link hand cursor / I-beam on
    selectable content.
- **CHANGED**: Desktop selection toolbar parity with stock Flutter:
  - On desktop (`macOS`, `Linux`, `Windows`), mouse drags, double/triple clicks,
    keyboard shortcuts (`Cmd/Ctrl+A`), and programmatic selection updates
    do not pop up the toolbar.
  - Right-click on desktop shows the context toolbar at the click coordinates
    without mutating the active selection (no select-word / caret collapse).
  - Desktop context menu preserves its right-click anchor when triggering
    actions such as "Select all", rather than jumping to selection endpoints.
  - Desktop context menu dismisses immediately upon scroll.
  - On mobile (`Android`, `iOS`), touch gestures and programmatic selection
    (`selectAll`, `selection = ...`) continue to present the adaptive toolbar
    and handles with action items.

### Autoscroll is scroll-protocol agnostic
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownAutoscrollTarget` — the scroll surface autoscroll drives,
  behind three members (`viewport`, `canScroll`, `applyScrollDelta`). Deltas are
  **screen-space content movement** (positive moves content up), never scroll
  offsets, so reverse axes and inverted anchors are the adapter's problem.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownScrollableAutoscrollTarget` — the built-in sliver adapter
  (`ScrollableState` / `ScrollPosition`), used when no resolver is configured.
  Handles `AxisDirection.up` / `.left` sign flipping.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionAutoscrollConfig.targetResolver`
  (`MarkdownAutoscrollTargetResolver` + `MarkdownAutoscrollRequest`) so a host
  with its own scroll implementation — an anchored chat viewport, a `RenderBox`
  that positions children itself, a transform canvas — can be driven without a
  `Scrollable` anywhere in the tree. Plus `MarkdownCallbackAutoscrollTarget` and
  `MarkdownAutoscrollViewport` (global bounds + band inset) for closure hosts.
- **CHANGED**: `applyMarkdownSelectionAutoscroll` takes an optional `target:`;
  `context:` is now optional and only used to resolve the built-in sliver
  target. Band, host-union gate and arming logic no longer reference
  `ScrollPosition` at all.
- **FIXED**: The scroll surface is resolved **once per drag** and cached. It
  used to walk the whole element subtree twice on every autoscroll frame (to
  find the surface's element, then the nearest `Scrollable`).
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionAutoscrollConfig.useHostUnionGate` (default
  `true`, the existing behaviour). Turn it off when the markdown bodies **are**
  the scrolling content and the host builds only what is visible: such a host's
  mounted union is barely larger than the viewport, so the gate would veto a
  drag that should keep paging through history. The target's `canScroll` and
  the delta it reports applying are then the only stops.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownSelectionAutoscrollConfig.copyWith`, `==` / `hashCode`.

### Selection engine rework
- **ADDED**: Edge-zone autoscroll while dragging (body / handle / long-press)
  near the padded viewport — host-union hard-stop, direction arming gate,
  past-viewport max velocity while the union still allows that direction
  (`MarkdownSelectionScope.autoscroll`, default `edgeZone: 48`).
- **CHANGED**: Toolbar hides while expanding (body or handle drag) and may
  re-show on drag end; anchors recompute on selection change, host/ancestor
  scroll, and mounted-surface layout change.
- **FIXED**: Scroll / geometry toolbar restore is skipped while a selection
  drag is active (`_dragGlobal`). Autoscroll `ScrollNotification`s must not
  re-present the adaptive toolbar mid-gesture even when `toolbarWanted` was
  re-armed (e.g. a host restoring a clamped range via the public `selection`
  setter).
- **CHANGED**: Toolbar placement — both endpoints in clip use stock
  above-preferring anchors; **bottom-only** endpoint prefers below that caret;
  neither endpoint in clip (tall mid-viewport) top-pins so the below-fallback
  cannot sink to the host bottom; empty intersection hides the overlay while
  `toolbarWanted` restores on scroll-back / remount.
- **FIXED**: Selection highlight stays outside the glyph `Picture` cache —
  under glyphs by default (sharp text), with a second pass **above** opaque
  chrome (`selectionHighlightAboveCachedContent`) for code fences, table zebra
  rows, and inline monospace / highlight backgrounds
  (`markdownSpansPaintOpaqueBackground`).
- **FIXED**: Focus loss does not clear selection while a pointer drag is active
  (list rebuilds during autoscroll); geometry walks defer off `performLayout`
  (`sizeAccessAllowed`).

## 0.2.0

> **Upgrading from 0.0.x?** See the
> [migration guide](docs/migration/0.0.x-to-0.2.x.md). 0.2.x is almost entirely
> backward compatible — the only required code change is a new `alert` branch
> for direct `MD$Block.map` / `switch` callers.

- **ADDED**: Opt-in, dependency-free syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks
  (65+ languages, GitHub light/dark themes). Assign a `SyntaxHighlighter` to the
  new `MarkdownThemeData.highlighter` field; the default (unset) renders code as
  plain monospace, so existing usage is unchanged. New public API on
  `package:flutter_md/highlight.dart`: `SyntaxHighlighter`, `MarkdownHighlighter`,
  `CodeHighlightTheme`, `Grammar`, `GrammarToken`, `compileHighlightPattern`
  (`SyntaxHighlighter` / `CodeHighlightTheme` are also re-exported from the main
  entrypoint). Each language is its own library
  (`package:flutter_md/highlight/<lang>.dart`, e.g. `HighlightDart.grammar`) with
  no central registry, so importing one never references the others and unused
  grammars tree-shake away — a Dart-only app adds ~0 beyond the engine; all 65
  add ~62 KB gzipped. `HighlightThemes.githubDark` / `githubLight`
  (`highlight/themes.dart`) provide ready themes; `allHighlightLanguages`
  (`highlight/all.dart`) is a convenience registry of every grammar for
  demos/tooling (it references all languages, so unused ones can no longer
  tree-shake away). The highlighter only partitions text — never edits it — so
  selection and copy stay aligned. Grammars are generated by
  `tool/highlight_codegen` (adapted from Prism, MIT).
- **ADDED**: Cross-block and cross-widget text selection. A
  `MarkdownSelectionController` anchors the selection on the immutable model, so
  it spans multiple blocks and multiple `MarkdownWidget`s and survives list
  disposal (e.g. chat scrolling). New public API: `MarkdownSelectionController`,
  `MarkdownSelectionScope`, `MarkdownSelectionGroup`, `MarkdownPosition`,
  `MarkdownSelection`, `MarkdownDocumentRef`, `MarkdownSelectedContent`
  (+ document/block), `MarkdownSelectionFormatter` /
  `MarkdownPlainTextFormatter` / `MarkdownMarkupFormatter`,
  `MarkdownReconciliationPolicy`, `MarkdownSelectionSurface`,
  `markdownBlockRenderedText`, and
  `SelectableBlockPainter` / `SelectableTextBlock`.
- **ADDED**: `StreamingMarkdownParser`, an incremental parser for streaming
  sources such as LLM token output. It freezes completed blocks (a block ends at
  a blank line, outside any open code fence) so only the still-growing tail is
  re-parsed as tokens arrive — turning the `O(N²)` cost of re-parsing the whole
  buffer on every token into roughly `O(tail)` (3–14× faster on a full message
  stream in `benchmark/streaming_benchmark.dart`). `parser.add(chunk)` returns
  the growing `Markdown`, always identical block-for-block to
  `Markdown.fromString(everythingSoFar)`, and a `Stream<String>.toMarkdown()`
  extension wires it into a stream transform. Pass a configured `MarkdownDecoder`
  (e.g. `inlineMath: true`) to match `Markdown.fromString`. The batch
  `MarkdownDecoder` hot path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownMarkupFormatter`, a built-in "Copy as Markdown" formatter.
  Pass it to `getText()` (or set `controller.formatter`) to reconstruct Markdown
  structure on copy — heading `#`s, nested list markers with task checkboxes,
  blockquote/alert `>` prefixes, fenced code and pipe tables — for blocks the
  selection covers in full; partially-selected boundary blocks fall back to the
  plain sliced text so nothing outside the selection is emitted. The default
  copy behaviour is unchanged (`MarkdownPlainTextFormatter`).
- **ADDED**: `MarkdownWidget` gains optional `documentId` and `controller`
  parameters (resolved from the ambient scope). Backward compatible: a widget
  with no `documentId` is inert.
- **ADDED**: Lists and tables are now interactively selectable. A new
  `MultiPainterSelectable` mixin (+ `SelectableFragment`) maps pointer positions
  and highlight boxes across the many `TextPainter`s of a list's items or a
  table's cells, so a drag can start or end inside a list item or table cell and
  the copied text keeps the `\n` / `\t` separators of `markdownBlockRenderedText`.
- **ADDED**: Keyboard shortcuts and a context toolbar on `MarkdownSelectionScope`,
  mirroring `SelectableRegion`/`SelectableText`. When focused: `Ctrl/Cmd+C`
  copies, `Ctrl/Cmd+A` selects all, `Shift`+arrows extend by character / word /
  line / document (and vertically by geometry), `Esc` clears. Right-click
  (desktop) / long-press (mobile) shows an adaptive Copy / Select-all toolbar.
  The scope is now a `StatefulWidget` with a public `MarkdownSelectionScopeState`
  (`copySelection` / `selectAll` / `clearSelection` / `showToolbar` /
  `hideToolbar` / `contextMenuButtonItems` / `contextMenuAnchors`). New
  customization params: `focusNode`, `enabled`, `selectionColor`,
  `contextMenuBuilder`, `magnifierConfiguration`, `selectionControls`,
  `onSelectionChanged`. New controller ops: `selectionColor`,
  `globalSelectionRects`, `moveSelectionEdgeToGlobal`, and the
  `extendSelectionBy*` family; `MarkdownPosition.copyWith`.
- **ADDED**: Native selection handles and a magnifier on touch platforms,
  driven by Flutter's `SelectionOverlay`. Selection endpoints push
  `LeaderLayer`s from the render objects so the handles follow the content as it
  scrolls (and across multiple `MarkdownWidget`s); dragging a handle adjusts the
  selection and shows the platform magnifier. Handles/magnifier respect the
  platform (`selectionControls`, `magnifierConfiguration`) and are absent on
  desktop, matching `SelectableText`. New surface geometry:
  `localSelectionRects`, `setSelectionHandleLayers`, `repaintSelection`, and
  `MarkdownSelectionController.selectionHandleEndpoints` /
  `MarkdownHandleEndpoints`.
- **ADDED**: Word- and block-granular selection gestures. Double-click/tap
  selects the word under the pointer, triple-click/tap selects the whole block,
  a single click collapses (clears) the selection, and `Shift`-click extends it.
  Dragging after a double/triple click keeps word/block granularity; a touch
  long-press grabs the whole word (then extends by word), and a touch
  double-tap selects the word and pops the toolbar. Word boundaries use the
  platform word segmentation (`TextPainter.getWordBoundary`), so double-click
  keeps intra-word punctuation like apostrophes (`can't`). New controller ops:
  `selectWordAtGlobal`, `selectBlockAtGlobal`, `wordSelectionAt`,
  `blockSelectionAt`, `extendSelectionGranular`, and `wordRangeIn`; new surface
  geometry `MarkdownSelectionSurface.wordBoundaryForGlobal`.
- **ADDED**: Mouse cursor feedback — a `MarkdownWidget` shows the click (hand)
  cursor over actionable links, the text (I-beam) cursor while it participates
  in a selection controller, and otherwise the default cursor.
- **CHANGED**: `MarkdownWidget`'s render object now draws the selection
  highlight outside the cached content `Picture` and becomes a repaint boundary
  when selectable, so selection/drag repaints do not rebuild the glyph cache.
  The highlight color is now customizable via the controller / scope. The
  highlight is painted on top of (rather than beneath) the glyphs, so a
  translucent selection stays visible over opaque backgrounds — code fences,
  `inline code`, and `==marked==` spans.
- **EXAMPLE**: Reworked the demo tabs — a longer, richer chat (tables, code,
  nested/task lists, alerts, math, token-by-token streaming with a typing
  indicator, Select-all/Clear) and a Selection tab that spans every block type.

## 0.1.0

- **ADDED**: GitHub-style alert blocks (`> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`,
  `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`) via the new `MD$Alert` block and `MD$AlertType`.
- **ADDED**: GitHub task-list items (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) via `MD$ListItem.checked`
  and `MD$ListItem.isTask`, rendered with a checkbox.
- **ADDED**: Table column alignment (`:---`, `:--:`, `---:`) captured on
  `MD$Table.alignments` and applied when rendering.
- **ADDED**: `linkStyle` on `MarkdownThemeData` to customize link text styling
  (thanks @inamhusain, #22).
- **ADDED**: Per-type alert accent colors via `MarkdownThemeData.alertColors`
  and `alertColorFor`.
- **ADDED**: Opt-in `$...$` inline LaTeX math conversion to Unicode, **disabled
  by default**. Enable with `MarkdownDecoder(inlineMath: true)` or
  `Markdown.fromString(text, inlineMath: true)`. Supports LaTeX commands
  (`\alpha`, `\rightarrow`, ...), superscripts/subscripts (`x^2`, `H_2O`,
  `x^{10}`), is code-span and code-block safe, and preserves currency (`$5`).
  The command table is configurable via `mathReplacements` (extend the
  exported `kMarkdownMathCommands`). Originally proposed in #21 by
  @ibragimov05.
- **FIXED**: `\$` is now a recognized backslash escape, producing a literal
  dollar sign (and opting a `$...$` run out of math conversion).
- **CHANGED**: Thematic breaks now support `***` and `___` (and spaced variants
  like `- - -`), and no longer greedily consume text after `---`.
- **CHANGED**: `~~~` fenced code blocks are now recognized in addition to ` ``` `.
- **FIXED**: Emphasis no longer leaks to the end of the line for stray or
  unterminated markers (e.g. `5 * 6 = 30`, `**bold never closed`).
- **FIXED**: Intraword underscores are no longer treated as emphasis
  (e.g. `snake_case`, `object_id` are preserved).
- **FIXED**: ATX headings require a space after `#`; `#hashtag` and 7+ `#`
  are no longer headings, and trailing `#` sequences are stripped.
- **FIXED**: Emphasis surrounding a link/image is now merged onto the link span.
- **FIXED**: Link/image targets support `<url>` and single-quoted titles.
- **FIXED**: `MarkdownThemeData.copyWith` no longer drops `builder` and `onLinkTap`.
- **BREAKING**: `MD$Block.map`/`maybeMap` gained an `alert` branch for the new
  `MD$Alert` block type.
- **PERFORMANCE**: Rewrote the parser hot path — a single-span fast path for
  plain text, first-code-unit guards that keep regexes off paragraph lines,
  hand-rolled list-line and link-target parsing (removing per-line / per-link
  `RegExp` allocation), lazy link-extraction gated on `[`, and a range-copy
  escape rebuild (no more per-character hash-set lookups). Together with math
  now being opt-in, the default parse path is roughly **45% faster** across
  representative workloads (links −68%, lists −61%, escapes −68%). Output is
  byte-identical, guarded by a golden snapshot test.
- **TESTS**: Added a golden characterization snapshot, a corner-case regression
  suite, span-offset invariants, and unit tests for the node model, theme, and
  widget; wired every test file into `test/unit_test.dart` so CI runs the full
  suite (**370+ tests**, previously only a fraction ran). `parser.dart`,
  `nodes.dart`, `markdown.dart`, `theme.dart`, and `widget.dart` are now at
  ~100% line coverage.
- **ADDED**: `benchmark/parser_benchmark.dart` (a multi-scenario
  `benchmark_harness` suite) and `benchmark/compare.dart` (a low-noise
  before/after comparison tool).
- **DOCS**: Documented alerts, task lists, table alignment, thematic-break
  variants, and opt-in inline math in the README.
